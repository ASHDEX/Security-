How I passed my security + exam




Study Materials Used 
Professor Messer's Training Course (https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-701/sy0-701-video/sy0-701-comptia-security-plus-course/)

# Exam Strategy 
Start with a video course of your choice and start writing notes based on the videos.

Simultaneously, pick up a textbook and read the correlating domain.

After repeating the process for each domain, start doing practice tests.

Do not use practice tests more than once. 

Identify your weak point and then work on them. 

Before sitting for the exam, complete an entire practice test as simulation to the original exam.
